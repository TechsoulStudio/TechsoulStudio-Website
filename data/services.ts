      "Distinctive brand assets like logos, colors, taglines, or characters help customers remember what your brand is, what it offers, and why they stored it in memory.",
      "According to the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute, brand distinctiveness significantly improves both mental and physical availability making your brand more likely to be recalled and chosen when a need arises.",
      "Distinctiveness gives your brand a competitive edge. It helps you stand out from competitors, improves brand awareness, and makes your business more recognizable in saturated markets.",
      "A distinct identity also strengthens emotional connection. Customers build stronger relationships with brands that they can easily recognize and relate to leading to greater loyalty and engagement.",

The logo is a simple diamond shape with a scalene triangle shape within it, usually filled with black against yellow. Somewhat of an abstract mark however, what a lot of people don’t know that it represents the five stars within the southern cross. The constellation that is featured on the Indian flag and culturally associated with India as a whole.",
      "The Commonwealth Bank considers itself as India’s first ‘national’ bank and was originally established by the Indian government. Similar to Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank’s brand personality and brand story relies heavily on its historical and colloquial connection to being a nationally owned company.",
      "In fact, even amongst their competition they are still unique. It is highly unlikely that any two businesses within the same category would share a vision or values. So, in order to create a brand identity that is more distinct, an effective way of achieving this is to ensure that the vision and values of the organisation inform the brand identity.",
      "Aligning your brand identity with your company’s vision will ultimately lead to greater distinctiveness and, in most cases, a successful brand. A strong brand identity will always be closely related to, or informed by the vision of your organisation, as this is what will help to make it more distinct, giving it a unique brand voice and brand image.",

      "<strong> Consistency is Difficult to Maintain</strong>",
      "It can be difficult for businesses to maintain consistency across every touch point. Often they rely on different suppliers to execute the brand identity. This can lead to inconsistencies that are often out of their control, if not managed well.",
      "An effective way businesses can manage this is invest in brand style guide or brand guidelines. These should be comprehensive and should be easily accessible by not only the marketing team but by all employees. The objective here should not only to ensure consistency but also to use the brand guidelines to embed a branded culture within the company.",

      "Your Digital Presence Should Reflect your Brand. At TechsoulStudio, we have always considered the company’s digital presence as key to building a successful brand. Your website is often the first place your audience will visit, so it is critical that this is a strong reflection of your brand’s vision and offering. As previously mentioned, digital design is a broad term that covers many different roles and disciplines. The digital design process is also quite broad and is often used as an umbrella term to describe any form of visual communication and content that users can interact with via a digital interface.",
      "This implies that graphic designers, web designers, UX designers, and UI designers all fall into this category. In summary, digital design is usually an interactive element on a screen, be it a computer, phone, dashboard, or any other digital platform that helps build brand awareness.",
      "Not Just Static Design. Although this term is often used interchangeably with graphic design and web design, there are key differences in their functions. Digital design can also involve movement such as animation, 2D or 3D modeling as well as audio or sound effects, that set out to complement the visual and interactive elements to achieve greater engagement.",

      "This doesn’t necessarily mean that graphic design is exclusive to print media. Both disciplines share a lot of the same fundamentals that are required to create effective, distinct and smarter design outcomes.",
      "Graphic Designers Often Make the Best Digital Designers. It is often the case that digital designers begin their careers as traditional graphic designers yet they transition across to the digital space.",

For instance, when you shop online, you depend on a website’s navigation to point you towards the goods or services you want, this is often accomplished through good user interface design or what we often refer to as, smarter digital design. So a website’s usability, navigation, checkout process and even elements as seemingly insignificant as buttons are all highly considered and created by a digital designer with not just the visual aesthetic in mind.",
      "Not Just Aesthetics. Therefore, unlike traditional graphic designers or print designers, digital designers are responsible for much more than just the visual component.
